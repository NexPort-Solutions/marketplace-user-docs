# Supplemental Info & Groups

Supplemental questions collect additional data at purchase/redemption and can drive group membership assignments in NexPort.

## Manage supplemental questions
1) Open `NexPort` → `Supplemental Info` (or your integration’s config area).
2) Add questions (single‑select or multi‑select) and define option values.
3) Option values can be linked to group memberships (e.g., select “Location A” → add to Group A).

## Include questions on a product mapping
1) Open the product’s `NexPort Product Mappings`.
2) Add the relevant supplemental questions to the mapping.
3) Save.

## Redemption with supplemental info
- Customers must answer required questions before redeeming. If unanswered, the Order Details page will prompt them.
- After submission, group memberships update based on answers.

## Maintenance
- You can edit or remove questions and options. Changes affect future redemptions; audit before modifying live mappings.
