# Products

Products are nopCommerce items that can be sold in one or more stores. When mapped, they create or extend training in NexPort.

## Categories
1) `Catalog` → `Categories` → `Add new`.
2) Provide Name and Description; optionally select a Parent category.
3) Save.

## Create a product
1) `Catalog` → `Products` → `+ Add New`.
2) Enter Name, Short description, and Full description.
3) (Optional) Assign categories.
4) Set `Price` (> 0 for paid products) and enable `Published`.
5) (Optional) Enable `Show on home page` and choose Display order.
6) Save.

## Copying products
- Use `Copy product` to duplicate and optionally copy NexPort mappings.

## Category purchase restrictions (optional)
- You can limit to one item per category or enable auto‑swap behavior (adds a new item and removes an existing item in the same category).

## Extensions
- Mark products as `Extension only` to restrict purchase to extension scenarios if supported by your mapping.

## NexPort mapping (overview)
- After you create/save a product, open it and scroll to the `NexPort Product Mappings` section to connect this nopCommerce product to a NexPort product/section.
- Create the Default Mapping first, then add per‑store mappings as needed.
- Choose redemption mode: `Auto‑redeem` for automatic assignment after payment, or keep manual redemption via the order’s Redeem link.
- Optionally set the Subscription Organization and include Supplemental Info questions if your workflow requires them.
- For detailed steps and options, see: [NexPort Mapping](nexport-mapping.md)
