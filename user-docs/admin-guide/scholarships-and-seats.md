# Scholarships & Seats

Scholarships (seats) represent pre‑purchased entitlements that can be assigned to learners by admins, purchasing agents, or library staff.

Common use cases
- Organizations bulk purchase seats and assign them to employees.
- Libraries purchase open scholarships and assign one seat per patron as they arrive.

Workflow: selling scholarships to libraries
1) Configure the store and products (fixed or open‑ended) that the library will offer.
2) Sell scholarships in bulk to the library organization.
3) As patrons arrive, staff assign available seats to a patron account (create or link as needed).

Assignment basics
- Seats can be auto‑assigned at purchase (auto‑redeem) or held for manual assignment.
- Ensure assignees have valid Marketplace/Campus accounts.

Monitoring
- Track available seats by order or product.
- Export reports or use store analytics to reconcile assignments.
