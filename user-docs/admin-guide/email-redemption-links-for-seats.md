# Email Redemption Links for Seats

Purchasing agents and admins can distribute seats by emailing redemption links to recipients who self‑redeem. This page explains statuses, cancel/resend, and best practices.

## When to use

* You want the recipient to create/link their account and complete any supplemental info.
* You don’t yet know the exact learner at purchase time.

## Send a redemption link

1. Open the order; locate an Available seat.
2. Choose Email redemption; enter the recipient’s email address.
3. The seat moves to Awaiting status until redeemed or canceled.

## Statuses

* Available: Seat is unassigned; no email sent.
* Awaiting: Email sent; not yet redeemed by the recipient.
* Redeemed: Recipient used the link; enrollment created in NexPort Campus.

## Cancel/resend

* Cancel an Awaiting redemption to reclaim the seat if the learner will not redeem.
* Resend the email if the recipient lost the link.

## Tips

* Include a short message in the email with context and support info.
* Recipients without accounts will be prompted to register before redemption.
* Supplemental questions (if configured) must be answered before the seat is redeemed.
