# Organization Purchases & Purchasing Agents

Organization purchases allow authorized purchasing agents to buy multiple seats in a product for assignment to others.

## Agreements and eligibility
- Require a wholesale or purchasing agent agreement on file before enabling bulk purchasing.
- Without an agreement, limit purchasing to standard retail flows.

## Known restriction
- If a purchasing agent already has an active enrollment/completion for a course, they may be blocked from purchasing more seats in that product. Confirm store policies and consider separate agent accounts if needed.

## Repurchase options
- Store settings can allow re‑purchase for failed or even passed courses, if appropriate to your program.

## Best practices
- Separate agent/assigner identities from learner identities when possible.
- Use store‑level sale model = wholesale (setting label) to enable appropriate UI and flows.
