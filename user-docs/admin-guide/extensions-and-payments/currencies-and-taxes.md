# Currencies & Taxes

Configure currency and (optional) tax settings appropriate for your hosted stores.

## Currencies
- Base/store currency: Confirm the correct currency per store. Mixedâ€‘currency scenarios should be coordinated with finance.
- Display vs processing: Ensure gateway configuration matches store currency.

## Taxes (if enabled)
- Determine whether your program requires taxes. If so, configure tax categories/rates with your accounting team.
- Verify tax is applied consistently on cart, orders, and refunds.
