# Purchasing Groups

Purchasing groups organize seats owned by an organization and define which purchasing agents can manage them.

Key concepts
- Purchasing Agent: A user who buys seats for others and manages assignments.
- Purchasing Group: The organization unit that owns seats.
- Owner Group: The group recorded on each seat/redemption for tracking and permissions.

Visibility and management
- Admins with permission can view all groups that a customer manages as a purchasing agent.
- Admins can view invoice items (seats) for each purchasing group to audit remaining capacity.

Setting the Owner Group on a seat
1) During assignment or in seat details, set the Owner Group to the correct purchasing group.
2) Owner Group drives visibility and reporting for that seat.

Purchasing without a group
- Some stores allow purchasing agents to buy seats without specifying a group at checkout.
- Admins can assign the Owner Group after the order is placed, before assignment.
