# Scholarships & Codes

Some organizations purchase seats (scholarships) or offer promo codes for learners.

Scholarships / seats
- Your admin may assign a seat to you. In library workflows, staff assign open scholarships as patrons arrive.
- If you receive an assignment email, follow the instructions to access or redeem the product.

Promo codes and discounts
- On the cart or checkout page, enter a promo code if you have one.
- Some discounts are exclusive and will pick the best single offer; others may stack (cumulative) depending on store rules.

Library membership
- Some stores validate library card numbers during registration. Enter the card number exactly as printed to pass validation.
