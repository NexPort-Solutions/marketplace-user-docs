# Stores & Branding

Each branded store has independent theme, catalog, pricing, and policies.

Create or edit a store
1) Go to `Configuration` → `Stores`.
2) Click `Add new` or edit an existing store.
3) Set name, URL, and branding.
4) Save.

Sale model (retail/wholesale)
- Under store settings, choose the sale model:
  - Retail: Standard one‑by‑one purchasing flows.
  - Wholesale: For purchasing agents and bulk seat purchases (requires business rules/agreements).

Default subscription organization
1) Open the store editor.
2) In the `Nexport Organization Subscription` section, search and select the organization (predictive search is supported).
3) Click `Set` to store the org GUID.
4) Save.

Notes
- Store‑level defaults (like subscription org) are used when product mappings don’t override them.
- Some features (e.g., custom registration fields) can be scoped to specific stores.
