# Redeeming Training

Products mapped to NexPort training can be redeemed automatically or manually, depending on how the store admin configured them.

Auto‑redeem
- Once payment is verified, your training is created automatically. Look for confirmation in Order Details or follow the `Launch` link provided by your store.

Manual redeem
1) Go to `My Account` → `Orders` and open the order.
2) If the product is not set to auto‑redeem, click `Redeem` next to the product.
3) If the store requires supplemental questions, answer them before redemption completes.

After redemption
- Your enrollment appears in NexPort Campus. Depending on the store, you may see a `Launch` link, or be directed to Campus to begin.

Notes
- If supplemental questions are outstanding, you will be prompted to answer them before redeeming.
- Admins should not manually change order status as it can break the redemption process.
