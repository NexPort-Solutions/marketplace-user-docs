# Browsing and Purchasing

Find products, add them to your cart, apply any discounts, and check out.

## Browse and search
- Use categories, search, and front page highlights to find products.
- Product pages show name, description, price, and any store‑specific details.

## Add to cart and checkout
1) From a product page, click `Add to cart`.
2) Open your cart to review items and quantities.
3) Enter a promo code or discount coupon if provided.
4) Proceed to checkout and complete payment.

## Category restrictions (if enabled)
- Some stores limit you to one product per category at a time. Adding a second may replace the first (auto‑swap) or block it.

## Order status
- After payment completes, the order moves to Completed and is ready for redeeming or auto‑assignment (depending on the product).
