# FAQ

How do I access my training after purchase?
- Open `My Account` → `Orders` and click `Redeem` (if manual). Auto‑redeem products will create training automatically.

Why can’t I add two items from the same category?
- Stores can restrict purchases to one item per category or auto‑swap; this is by design.

My library card is being rejected at registration.
- Some stores validate specific formats. Contact your library if your card number format has changed or if you need assistance.

My Marketplace login works but I can’t launch training.
- Ensure your NexPort Campus profile is linked. If not, sign in with your Campus credentials or contact your admin.
