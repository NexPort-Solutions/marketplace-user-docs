# Account & Registration

You can sign in or register directly in a store. NexPort Marketplace links your account to NexPort Campus so training can be delivered and tracked.

Registering a new account
1) Go to your store URL and click `Register`.
2) Complete the form. Some stores show custom fields (e.g., department, location, library card); these are required when present.
3) Submit to create your Marketplace account and linked NexPort Campus profile.

Signing in with an existing NexPort Campus account
1) Click `Log in` in the store.
2) Enter your existing Campus email/password.
3) Marketplace creates a linked profile automatically. Your name and contact info sync from Campus.

Troubleshooting
- If you can’t access Marketplace but your Campus account works, contact your store admin; some admin permission policies can affect access.
- Library stores may validate library card numbers at registration. Follow on‑screen instructions if your card format is rejected.
