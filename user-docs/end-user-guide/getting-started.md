# Getting Started

Welcome to NexPort Marketplace. Many organizations run multiple branded stores. This guide helps you find a store, sign in, and begin purchasing training.

What you need
- A store URL from your organization (example: `https://nexportmarket.com`)
- An email address for your account

Steps
1) Open your store URL.
2) Click `Log in` or `Register`.
3) If you already have a NexPort Campus account, sign in with that email/password to link your Marketplace account automatically.
4) If you’re new, complete registration. Some stores require extra fields (e.g., job role, library card). Fill any required fields to continue.
5) You’re ready to browse, add items to your cart, and check out.

Tips
- Stores are brand‑specific. Prices, products, and fields can vary per store.
- If your organization gave you a promo code or scholarship, keep it handy for checkout or redemption.
